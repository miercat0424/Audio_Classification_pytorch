# Audio processing library for PyTroch
    - on the google trend the Pytorch getting more popularity
    - Running audio feature extraction on GPU is efficient
    - using librosa too 

# What to do 
    - Overview of PyTorch and torchaudio
    - build , train , evaluate DL models in Pytorch
    - make inferemce with PyTorch Models
    - load audio datasets with custom PyTorch datasets
    - Perform audio feature extraction on GPU using torchaudio
    - USE CNN models for sound classification

# What should you expect ? 
    - Mainly coding
    - Little to no theory
    - 1 sample project

# Urban sound classification
    - sound -> NN model -> figure out 
    - Multicalss calssification problem
    - UrbanSound 8k dataset
    - 10 sound classes
